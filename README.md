# DATENIGHT

<h3> Project DATENIGHT </h3>

Requirement

Planning a date can be stressful. While there is not a lot you can do to alleviate that stress, some things can certainly be simplified – specifically, choosing where to go and what to do.  

Provide an interface that helps the user to identify: 
o	one form of entertainment 
	movie, activity, game, etc.
o	one area to visit 
	Restaurant, Park, etc.
And keep track of which date they are planning: 
o	created title
o	date
o	time

You are expected to work together as a team to accomplish this task together. Utilize some of the agile fundamentals you have been exposed to over the past week and feel free to ask questions – we are expecting them! 

The requirement is defined broadly on purpose to ensure that you can scale the body of work to your collective skill-level while also flexing your creativity. 


Timeline

Your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is due in 2 weeks. A Demo is planned for your final day in the Engineering rotation (1 March), but you should plan to have the work completed by the end of business on the day before (28 February).

During your Demo, you will present the application to the stakeholders, and we would like to hear from all of you. Please plan to share what decisions you made, why you went in that direction, and be prepared for questions from those present. 


Technical Goals

At a base level, your web app should perform an API call, pull back the desired data, and display the applicable information while also providing the user the ability to assign a title and associate the plan with a date & time.  

Should you be tempted to add any additional functionality, please keep in mind that we are only looking for an MVP. Build this with the mindset that it could be enhanced in follow-on iterations if they were to exist. There is no need to try and insert anything complex as this is a project designed to show your ability to work together to produce a technical product from an ambiguous requirement in an agile fashion.
